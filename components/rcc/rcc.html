			<h2>Student Testimonals</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
				📌”The dining hall here has been under construction since before I got here. I often run down to the Oakes cafe for some food. The libraries are too far away, so I stay in my room.”
			</li>
			<li>
📌”I only go to the libraries if my classes are around there, otherwise I stay in my room. I go to the Porter/Kresge dining hall, so I’m covered on food.”
</li>
<li>
📌”I think that the oakes dining hall is a good place to eat, and study, actually.”
</li>
<li>
📌”I like the environment here and often meet with friends to study in my room. Occasionally, we’ll study in the dining hall.”
</li>
<li>
📌”I think RCC is just far enough away from everywhere that eating or studying anywhere is a trek.”
</li>
<li>
📌”I don’t like the food at Porter, but the dining hall here still isn’t open, so I just gotta stick with it, you know?”
</li>
<li>
📌”I think that we have to agree that the Oakes dining hall is te best place to eat and study in. It kind of is a nice, peaceful place to be. But once the dining hall opens up, i’m sure it’ll be great.”
