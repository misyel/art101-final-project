			<h2>Student Testimonals</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
				📌-”I’m not fond of the dining hall, I’ll be honest, and the trek back from the library often leads me to just study in my dining hall.”
			</li>
			<li>
📌-”The food is kinda mid in the dining hall, but the study rooms around here are alright. I also think the library is easy to get to, but walking back up the hill from there, or even just from the bus stop kinda sucks.”
</li>
<li>
📌-”I like the food alright. It’s pretty good. The library is kinda boring, but that’s kind of the point, right? And the study rooms? They’re okay.”
</li>
<li>
📌-”Because of how far the library is and how much of an effort it is to get there, i often choose to study in one of the study rooms unless I’m gonna be studying for hours, because I admittedly get distracted in the study rooms.”
</li>
<li>
📌-”I don’t actually visit the dining hall all that much. I’m a study-er, so I often get food from the cafe in the library.”
