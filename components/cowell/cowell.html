			<h2>Student Testimonals</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
			📌	-”We are not too far from the library or dining halls, so you’re kind of set if you come to this college.”
		</li>
		<li>
📌-”I like living here purely because of the awesome dining hall.”
</li>
<li>
📌-”The library is through this nice little walk through the woods which can be nice during the day, but a little concerning at night. I like the food anywhere on campus, and I think my favorite is the 9/10 dining hall, but the dining hall here is cool, too. And easier to get to.”
</li>
<li>
📌-”I like the dining halls, but they’re all the same to me. And between the two libraries, I think S&E is the one you want if you really want to crack down on homework.”
</li>
<li>
📌-”The engineering library has a more serious vibe to it while the McHenry one is more relaxed, so I guess whichever works best for any individual is the one they want. And I personally think the dining hall is the best place on campus.”
</li>
📌-”Easy question. Dining hall here is the best. The libraries are cool. The study rooms are okay, I guess? I haven’t been in any of them.”
<li>
📌-”I don’t live here, but I wish that I did simply because the dinner menu at Stephenson/Cowell is THE best.”
</li>
<li>
📌-”I’ve visited a few times, but I do not believe that the dining hall is the best, even though a lot of my friends say it is. I also think the college is kinda far away from everything.”
</li>
<li>
📌-”Best college to go to. Best food, best views, best everything.”
